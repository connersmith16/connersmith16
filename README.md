Hello!
My name is Conner Smith, I am a Lieutenant in the United States Navy actively transitioning into the civilian sector. I am a masters in Data Science student
at the University of Texas at Austin (online offering). The past 6 years of my career in the Navy have been logisitcs and supply chain focused, and while I hope
that experience will be useful in the future, I want to transition into the software development and data science world.
